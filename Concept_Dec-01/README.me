1. Writing JS in separate file.
2. Why to write CSS in head and JS in body after all the content.

1. let vs var

2. hoisting:
> Hoisting is the process where the JS engine moves the declaration of variable / functions / classes to the top of their scope (global or functional).
> This allows us to use variables or functions which are not defined without crashing the script.
