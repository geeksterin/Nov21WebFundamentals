//Null vs Undefined.

//Undefined -> You have declared a variable but not defined yet!
//Null -> you have defined the variable with nothing.
//Null is a data and it has it's own data type (primitive)

var a;

a = 10;
a = null;

console.log(a);

// console.log(null == undefined);
// console.log(null == "");
