# Hi <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35px">, I am Aayush Sinha

I will be one of your instructors. I will be with you till end of this course and I will be sharing with you all things Web Development. You can reach out to me on Teams or after class for any sort of doubt or discussion.

A bit about me, I work at a KEMURI as a Senior Engineer and have been in this field for over 7 years. I work on MERN Stack but I like to call myself as a Javascript Developer I am looking forward for you geeks to become one too.


## That's it for now
Let's get Developing!
