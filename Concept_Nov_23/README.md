## Content Covered
- Programming Language?
    - Programming Language is a language used to communicate between humans and machines. Mostly used programmers.
    - C, C++, Java, Javascript, etc are examples of various Programming Languages.
- Algorithm?
    - Set of rules/steps/instruction which are to be executed by the machine.
- rules/steps/instruction?
    - A single command to be executed.
- Pseudo Code
    - Pseudo -> False / Fake.
    - Not an actual programming code, but steps of instructions written in plain human language. Communicate between human to human. (Informal Language)
- ***Calculate Sum of Two numbers***
- ***Detect whether number1 can be divided by number2 or not***
- ***Show numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6... upto user input number1.***
- Algorithm vs Program.
    - A single program can contain multiple algorithms.
- Interpreted Languages vs Compiled Languages
    - Interpreted -> Line by Line conversion of HLL -> LLL
    - Compiled -> Complete source code is compiled from HLL -> LLL
    - Interpreted is executed line by line. Compiled is compiled into a single file and then executed.
- High Level Languages (HLL) vs Low Level Languages (LLL)
    - High Level Language -> Understandable by Humans. Not exactly by machines.
    - Low Level Language -> Assembly code (mostly understandable by machines, not by humans)
- Javascript is same as Java? NO!
- Is JS interpreted or Compiled? Interpreted!
- Scripting Languages vs Programming Languages:
    - Scripting Language -> Interpreted Languages. (JS/ES/TS, Python, PHP, Ruby, VBasic, Bash, etc)
    - Programming Language -> Interpreted + Compiled
- Variable
    - A piece of memory which can contain data (assigned or updated) | Case Sensitive | Cannot start with a number.
- Constant
    - A piece of memory which can contain data (onyl assigned, cannot be updated).
- console.log();
- Data Types:
    - Boolean (true / false)
    - Number (0, 1, 2, 1.5, 2.8, 483.2)
    - String ("Any text written inside a double or a single quote")
    - Array (["Element 1", "Element 2"])
    - Objects()
- Primitive vs Non Primitive
- Strongly Typed vs Loosely Typed Languages:
    - **Strongly typed (Tightly Typed) programming language** -> During first time assignment, we have to give the data type. It cannot be changed in future.
    - **Loosely typed (Dynamically Typed) programming languages** -> The type of data being stored in a variable can change at any point of time.
- Assignment Operator (=)
- Comparison Operator (==)
- Difference between Single = and Double ==
    - Single =  -> Assignment Operator, it will save the value in a variable (or whatever).
    - Double == -> Comparison operator, it will compare the LHS with RHS.
- Conditionals:
    - if
    - else
- Loop:
    - while

## Assignment
1. Check whether the given number is a prime number or not.
2. Generate a Fibonacci series upto a number n.
    - In fibonacci series, the next number is calculated by taking the sum of previous two numbers.
    - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... âˆž
