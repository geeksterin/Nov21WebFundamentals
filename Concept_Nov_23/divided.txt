Q. Whether number 1 can be divided by number 2 or not:
1/2 => False || 8/4 => True || 9/3 => True || 3/0 => Undefined.

Steps:
1. Take input of number 1.
2. Take input of number 2.
3. Check whether number 2 is equal to 0 or not. (If true)
    3.1 Output "Cannot divide by 0"
4. Divide number 1 by number 2 and store the remainder in "rem" variable.
5. If rem is equal to 0:
    5.1 Output "Number is divisible"
6. Otherwise (else):
    6.1 Output "Number is not divisible"
