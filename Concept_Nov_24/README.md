# Concept Class Nov-24-2021

## Content Covered
- Variables vs Constants
- Conditionals / Branching:
    - if
    - else
    - else if
- Loops / Iteration:
    - while
    - for
    - do while
- Entry Controlled Loops vs Exit Controlled Loops:
- Difference between while and do while.
- alert();
- prompt() -> To take input from the user.
- Concatenation -> Addition (combination) of strings.
    ```
    str1 = "abcd";
    str2 = "xyz";

    str1 + str2 => "abcdxyz";
    ```
- Strict Comparison (===)
- Difference between =, == and ===.
- Nesting
    - Something inside something else.
        ```

- ***Print numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.... upto n.***
