## Content Covered
- Objects
    - Key Value Pair
    - Properties
    - Accessing a Property
    - Adding / Updating a Property
    - Getting List of all keys
    - Getting List of all values
- Delete keyword
- Arrays vs Objects:
    - Arrays:
        - Collection of Elements
        - Uses index (A Number that Starts with 0)
        - The sequence of elements is important.
        - Use this when you will be having a list of data you want 
        - For example, TODO List, Chat Message List, FB Friend Lsit
    - Objects:
        - Collection of Key Value pairs.
        - Uses the concept of keys (Can be custom defined)
        - The sequence is not important.
        - Use this when you have to store properties of something.
        - For example, properties of a amazon product, properties of the logged in user, properties of a fb post.
- Switch Case Conditionals / Branching:
    - switch whether the message is being sent by which user (Group chat). Calculator, ATM Machine (switch operation, case withdrawal, case balance_enquiry).
    - Where equal comparison is between a variable and a data. (operator == '+', operator == '-').
    - Where you have multiple conditions executing same stuff.
- break statement
- ***Write a program to display the number in String format***
- ***1 -> 'One' ; 2 -> 'Two' ; 3 => "Three"***
- ***Write a program to check whether the number if odd or even***
- ***Start Kaun Banega Crorepati***
- JSON -> JavaScript Object Notation:
    - Basically used to save complex data structure (Nesting of different types)
    - Also used in network calls. Sending data to the server, getting data from the server.

## Assignment
1. Write a program to calculate Factorial of a number.
    - Factorial of 5 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
    - Factorial of 3 = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
    - Factorial of 10 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 10 = 3628800
    - Factor of number n is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * ..... * n
2. Write a program to check whether the two strings are anagram of each other or not.
    - "race", "care" <- true
    - "heart", "earth" <- true
    - "listen", "silent" <- true
    - "aaab" <->  "abaa", "baaa", "aaba" <it has 3 a and 1 b>
    - "aaab" <-> "aabb" <- false
    - In general, compare the count of each of the characters.

### Further Interest
- How would you check if a number is an integer?
- Given a string, reverse each word in the sentence.
